## INTRO:

My Goal as an instructor is to help you understand the "Why","What", and "How" of ML.

### "The Why"

Why does this technology exist?
		
Before this tech existed it was just a "crazy" idea someone had?

### "The What"
					
#### What are humans good at?
i.e. creative, learning and making decisions from experience/the world around us, we are good at connecting and learning from new input from the world around us

#### What are computers good at?
i.e. Following Instructions, doing math very quickly, 

#### What are humans bad at?
i.e. Following instructions 
#### What are computers bad at?
i.e. Learning from experience
### What is ML and what does it have to do with what we've talked about?
Machine learning is an attempt to bridge the gap between what computers are good at and what humans are good at, namely a computer gets some unique input data and is programmed to QUICKLY generate some simple response from it has learned from previous input.
EXAMPLE:

### "The How"
Machine Learning is advancing and become increasingly approachable and accessible. Machine Learning algorithms and solutions are availabe in libraries and modules in many different languages like Python, Scala, C/C++, and Julia. In fact, we can program machine learning in Scratch!
